## Abstract

Protein-protein interaction and metal-mediated adduct formation between copper chaperone Atx1 and the first copper(I)-binding domain of the Ccc2 ATPase is essential for Cu(I) trafficking from cell membrane to Golgi apparatus. 

Using multiple short unbiased MD trajectories of the partner proteins, we developed a **Markov State Model (MSM)** to study energetics and kinetics of the protein association events and map the initial binding mechanisms. The model identified an array of pre-organization events in the binding sites which are structurally essential for the metal transfer reaction. 

### Key Outcomes:
* Characterization of allosteric relations between inter-protein interaction regions and chemical reaction sites.
* Determination of correct protonation states of cysteine residues using DFT calculations.
* Proposed a reversible free energy profile for the reaction, consistent with previous protein analogue studies.

Protein-protein interaction and metal-mediated adduct formation between copper chaperone Atx1 and the first copper(I)-binding domain of the Ccc2 ATPase is essential for Cu(I) trafficking from cell membrane to Golgi apparatus. The interplay between the timescale separated protein association/dissociation events and Cu(I) metal transfer reaction involving cysteine thiols/thiolates, is not well understood. Due to the solvent exposed and fluctuating nature of the protein binding sites, it is necessary to look into the dynamics as well as the thermodynamics of the entire transfer mechanism between proteins. Using multiple short unbiased MD trajectories of the partner proteins we developed a Markov state model to study energetics and kinetics of the protein association events and map the initial binding mechanisms. The model also identified an array of preorganization events in the binding sites which are structurally essential for the metal transfer reaction. We also performed free energy calculations based on these possibilities and thus propose a most probable outline of events responsible for the reaction and get an estimate of the free energy profile which shows the process as a reversible one, consistent with previous studies. Another outcome of this study is the characterization of allosteric relation between the inter-protein interaction regions and chemical reaction sites. We also characterize the correct protonation states of the cysteine residues in the binding site of the acceptor protein in light of these association events using DFT calculations, which further facilitate the understanding of the reaction mechanism involved in cellular copper(I) trafficking.
